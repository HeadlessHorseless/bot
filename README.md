This site only exists because i cant fit any other link into a steam name
- List of sites i tried to put into a name
- [HeadlessHack](https://headlesshorseless.github.io/HeadlessHack)
- [Headless Website](https://headlesshorseless.github.io/Headless-Website)
- [Headless Downloads](https://headlesshorseless.github.io/Headless-Downloads)
- now, List of sites i actually fit into a name
- [you](https://headlesshorseless.github.io/you)
- bot (you are here right now)
- Fun fact: if you discover one of my bots you must be very unlucky to find him as only 1 exists
- sometimes the bot is instead an anti bot bot (it switches around every now and then)
- and 1 lucky bot account got upgraded to premium meaning potential micspam + chat spam
